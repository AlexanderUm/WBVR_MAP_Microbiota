 # The following analysis pipeline is a suplementary material for the publication. 
 
 The goal of this pipeline is to provide a clear inside into statistical analysis and 
 promote reproducibility of results. 
 
 Disclaimer: 
 1. The pipeline is not intended as a guidline for analysis of microbiota data and 
     contains a large number of fuctions apliciable only in the context in of the used data. 
 2. The pipeline is not optimized for perforamce and in particullary for RAM use. 
     Certain scripts will require around 126 Gb of RAM to run and will crash if a system has less. 
 3. To follow the pipeline step by step a Linux operating system (Debain) required.
